# [Tuxtale](https://github.com/UbuntuJackson/Tuxtale).
Tuxtale is an EarthBound & Undertale inspired RPG game, made with [brux-gdk](https://github.com/KelvinShadewing/brux-gdk).

## Development status
This game is in **VERY** early development, so it may have many features missing, or not fully working.

Many of this game's assets are from **[SuperTux Advance](https://github.com/kelvinshadewing/supertux-advance)** (at least for the time being).

## Running the game
1. Download a [brux-gdk nightly build](http://kelvinshadewing.net/dl/brux-nightly.zip) and extract it.
2. Download or clone the contents of this repository.
3. Run `game.brx` (included here) with `brux.exe` (included with the brux-gdk nightly build).
